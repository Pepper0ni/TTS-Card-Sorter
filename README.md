# TTS-Card-Sorter
A script that can be used to quickly and easilly sort decks of cards by thier name within Tabletop Simulator, as well as a special sort for sorting Pokemon Cards created by my Pack Simulator script and a duplicate removed for assisting with sealed play.

To use the sorter place the deck you wish to sort on the right-hand side green tile, then click one of the 3 sort buttons. the newly sorted deck will appear on the left-hand side red tile.

The 3rd sort is a Pokemon TCG specific sort that comes close to PTCGO's sorting, but is only compatible with cards generated by my Pokemon TCG with Booster Pack Simulator mod, and any future mods made to be compatible with it.

The last option is the ability to automatically remove cards from a deck until no more than 4 copies of any card exist, a feature meant to assist in drafts and sealed play. This is used similarly to the sorter, except only the removed cards appear on the red tile.
